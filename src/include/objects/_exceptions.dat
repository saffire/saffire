# Exception definitions
#
# Every line is an exception. The indentation decides which is the baseclass of the exception. Exceptions with no
# indentations are based on the generic "exception" class.
#
# Rebuild the _exceptions.h and _exception.inc file after modifying this file by running the ./create_exceptions.php
# script.
