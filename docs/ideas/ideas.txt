There will be a saffire class, that holds all information. It will act sort of like the /proc meta filesystem where
you can easily configure and view details about saffire.

garbage collection can be set per context (?)  saffire.gc.algo = SAFFIRE_GC_ALGO_TRAIN  for instance

All classes extend a saffire-base-class. This (final) class contains methods like clone, memory, etc.
