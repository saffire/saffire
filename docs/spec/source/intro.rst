Welcome to Saffire! 

A web-language in the making that tries to bring the best of the current web languages available: Python, PHP and Ruby,
mixed with its own twist.


------------

**Everything is an object**
	Everything in Saffire is an object. This include scalar values like strings, numeric and booleans.

**No global functions**
	There will be no global functions available. All functionality is based on classes, for instance, the print() method
	is based in the io class.

**UTF-8 out of the box**
	All string are UTF-8 compatible. A length on a string will return the actual number of characters, not the number of
	bytes.

**Operator overloading**
	It's possible to overload operators like + and -. This would make working with objects more readable.

**Method overloading**
	Depending on the arguments passed, different methods with the same name can be called. Instead of having one single
	method handling all different kind of objects, you can separate them nicely into different methods.
