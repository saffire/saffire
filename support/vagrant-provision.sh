Vagrant Development Box. This box runs on ubuntu64 bit server edition. 

All neccessary tools and libraries are installed to compile Saffire. Please run the following:

  $ cd /vagrant
  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ ./configure [--enable-debug]
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

This will compile and install a Saffire binary in /usr/local/bin/saffire. From this point you can use 
saffire by issuing:

  $ saffire help

Or start executing your first saffire file with:

  $ saffire ./hello.sf

Have fun!
