This directory contains scripts that generated parts of the source code. It is needed for mostly
generated classes that are too big to be done through regular macro's.

Normally, for compiling, we do not need to run these scripts, as we ship the source-code with
our generated result. If something changes in the source dat file, they will be automatically
regenerated.
