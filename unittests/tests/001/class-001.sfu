author: Joshua Thijssen <joshua@saffire-lang.org>

# Every unittest consist of a header block inside at least 2 **'s.
# Every header block must at least have the following tags:
#    title      The title of the testsuite
#    author     The author or authors
#
# Comments can be started with a # as the first character of the line.
#
# Empty lines are ignored.
#
# After the headers, 0 or more tests will be added.
# Every test is separated by at least 2 @@'s.
# Every test has a source-code and optionally an output expectation, both separated by at least two =='s.
# If no output is given, any non-zero resultcode from saffire will result in a failure.

# Output of the unittests will be something like:
#
#  Saffire Test Suite v0.1 - The Saffire Group
#  Start time: 12:34:56
#  001\modifiers-001.sfu: Class tests: ...........XX...X.X.XX..
#  001\modifiers-001.sfu: Method modifiers tests: .....
#  End time: 12:35:00 (4 seconds running time)
#
#  Status:
#    Test suites:   4
#    Total tests:  16
#    Passed:       12 (75.00%)
#    Failed:        4 (25.00%)
